# Problem Statement
## DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY
### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:

- 1.Total Loan Applications:We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).

- 2.Total Funded Amount:Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.

- 3.Total Amount Received:Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

- 4.Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.

- 5.Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):  Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.


### Loan Status Grid View
- In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.â€™ By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.

## DASHBOARD 2: OVERVIEW
- 1.Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.

- 2.Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional disparities.

- 3.Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart):To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term lengths.

- 4.Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.

- 5.Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.

- 6.Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
